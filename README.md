# Relationships Between Health and Logged Video Game Play Across Platforms

This repo documents the data and analysis code for our project on the relationship between video game play and wellbeing. It has four main components:
- generating simulated data to illustrate our preregistered analyses
- documenting the data and creating a vodebook
- preprocessing the data for analysis 
- data analysis for three outputs, structured to match our programmatic registered report. 

To reproduce the project in its entirety, run `quarto render --profile internal` (for lab members), or `quarto render --profile external` (for non-lab members). More details are provided below. 

## Scripts

The first script generates a series of 8 simulated data tables, overviewed in `codebook.xlsx`. Generating the simulated  data is only possible by **internal** users, but the code is available in `0_generateSyntheticData.qmd`. The remaining scripts can be run by **external** users.

These data tables are generated in the following scripts:

- In `0_generateSyntheticData.qmd`, we simulate a total of 8 data tables that will mimic the structure of the eventual
- In `1_preprocess.qmd`, we clean the data and calculate relevant derived variables (e.g., mean scores, play behavior metrics, and so on).

We then analyze these data in the following scripts:

- In `2_basicNeeds.qmd`, we present the analysis code for Study 1: the relationship between basic needs and video game play.
- In `3_sleep.qmd`, we present the analysis code for Study 2: the relationship between sleep and video game play.
- In `4_genres.qmd`, we present the analysis code for Study 3: the relationship between video game genres and video game play.
- In `9_screenshots.qmd`, we present work-in-progress optical character recognition code for extracting screen use data from iOS screenshots. 

## Hygiene files

- `.Renviron` defines the path to key internal data files and API credentials.
- `index.qmd` is the header file that stitches the other Quarto files together into book form. 
- `_quarto-internal.yml` defines the order in which files are run and project-level variables for **internal** use 
- `_quarto-external.yml` defines the order in which files are run and project-level variables for **external** use (same as `_quarto-internal.yml` with the exception of not running `0_generateSyntheticData.qmd`)

## Running

- For **external use** (non-lab members), run `quarto render --profile external` in the Rstudio terminal to render all of the quarto files except 0_generateSyntheticData.qmd, which requires internal credentials. This command uses the specifications in `_quarto-external.yml` to render the files in the correct order (indicated by their number), and output them to `outputs/`.

- For **internal use**, run `quarto render --profile internal` in the Rstudio terminal to render *all* quarto files. This command uses the specifications in `_quarto-internal.yml` to render the files in the correct order (indicated by their number), and output them to `docs/`. The files in `docs/` are hosted on GitHub pages here: [https://digital-wellbeing.github.io/platform-study-rr/](https://digital-wellbeing.github.io/platform-study-rr/).
